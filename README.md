# ultimate_alarm_clock
Originally designed as a parody of the Ahmed Mohamed clock that scandalized Texas in 2015.


I made this clock soon after the Ahmed Mohamed incident ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Mohamed_clock_incident ) to poke fun at the
reaction of school officials to Ahmed's crude re-packaging of a commodity digital alarm clock.  The clock I made (which I powered
by batteries and took with me to Halloween parties, dressed in the NASA tee shirt Ahmed was arrested wearing) was in the exact same pencil
case Ahmed had used, though all the electronics were custom, including the firmware, which is the substance of this repository.  The clock, written in the Arduino IDE, could show time, hold ten alarms, show brief messages, and (because I was making fun of the hypersensitivity-to-terrorism aspect of Ahmed's arrest) also count down and make various troubling sounds, such as explosions, 
the Muslim call to prayer, and a brief passage of Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song."

The clock is still the chief timepiece in my "laboratory" (my home office).
